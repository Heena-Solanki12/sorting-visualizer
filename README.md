# 📊 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive **web-based visualization tool** for learning how various sorting algorithms work. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project helps users understand sorting through animated, real-time visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to provide a hands-on and intuitive approach to understanding the internal working of popular sorting algorithms. It is designed for computer science students, educators, and enthusiasts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Visualize sorting algorithms step-by-step:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Radix Sort**
- 🎛️ Adjustable speed control
- 📐 Adjustable number of bars (data size)
- 🔁 Shuffle/Unsort functionality
- 🧠 View sorting algorithm logic in popup
- 💻 Responsive and interactive UI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic, DOM manipulation, and animation
- **Visual Studio Code** – Development environment
- **Web Browsers** – Chrome, Firefox, Edge (for testing and viewing)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each bar represents a numeric value.
- Bars are randomized on initialization.
- When a sorting algorithm is selected, bars are animated to reflect each step of sorting:
  - Comparisons are highlighted.
  - Swaps are animated.
  - Final sorted bars are shown in order.
- Users can adjust animation speed and bar count using sliders.
